## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You only need a modern web browser and optionally a local server for development.

**Optional but recommended:**
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for running a local server)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (for version control)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jay-1409/progressBoard-Frontend.git
   cd progressBoard-Frontend
   ```

2. **Open in browser**
   
   **Option A: Direct file access**
   ```bash
   # Simply open index.html in your browser
   open index.html  # macOS
   start index.html # Windows
   xdg-open index.html # Linux
   ```

   **Option B: Using a local server (recommended)**
   ```bash
   # Using Python
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js (http-server)
   npx http-server .
   
   # Using VS Code Live Server extension
   # Right-click index.html → "Open with Live Server"
   ```

3. **Access the application**
   
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the port specified by your server)

---

## 📖 Usage

### Basic Navigation

1. **Dashboard**: View all your progress items at a glance
2. **Groups**: Organize items into categories or projects
3. **Individual Items**: Click on any item for detailed view

### Customization

To connect your own backend or data source:

1. **Modify API endpoints** in the JavaScript files
2. **Update data models** to match your backend schema
3. **Customize styling** by editing CSS files
4. **Add new widgets** by creating new HTML components

Example:
```javascript
// Update API endpoint in your JS file
const API_URL = 'https://your-backend-api.com/api';

async function fetchProgressData() {
  const response = await fetch(`${API_URL}/progress`);
  const data = await response.json();
  renderDashboard(data);
}
```
